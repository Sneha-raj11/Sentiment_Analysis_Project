## 🌟 Sentiment Analysis using Hugging Face BERT & Transformers 🤗

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis 📝 — a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

It leverages Hugging Face Transformers 🤖 and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to analyze text and classify sentiments into Positive 😊, Negative 😞, or Neutral 😐.

The pipeline performs text purification, tokenization, and classification, making it simple and powerful for real-world applications.

## 🚀 Features
🧹 Text purification before processing

🤗 Transformer-based pipeline for Sentiment Analysis

📊 Visualization of results with Matplotlib

⏱️ Efficient runtime handling with Time & Sys modules

🔥 LLM (Large Language Model) integration for better text understanding

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Language: Python 🐍

Frameworks & Libraries:

🤗 Hugging Face Transformers

🧠 BERT Model

🛠️ Pipelines API
