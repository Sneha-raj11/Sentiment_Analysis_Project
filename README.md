## 🌟 Sentiment Analysis using BERT & Transformers

This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis 📝 — a core task of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
It leverages Hugging Face Transformers 🤗, particularly the BERT model, to classify text sentiments as Positive 😊, Negative 😞, or Neutral 😐.

The model pipeline performs text purification, tokenization, and classification with the help of Transformers pipelines API.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Text Preprocessing & Purification

✅ Transformer-based Sentiment Classification

✅ Easy-to-use Pipelines from Hugging Face

✅ Visualization with Matplotlib 📊

✅ Efficient Execution with Time & Sys Modules

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries & Frameworks:

🤗 Hugging Face Transformers

🧠 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

📊 Matplotlib (for data visualization)

🧹 Pipelines (for easy NLP tasks)

⏳ Time, Sys (for runtime efficiency)

## 📊 Visualization

Using matplotlib, you can visualize the sentiment distribution across multiple texts for better insights.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

🔹 Deploy as a Flask/FastAPI web app

🔹 Real-time sentiment analysis with streaming data

🔹 Extend to multi-class emotion detection (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
